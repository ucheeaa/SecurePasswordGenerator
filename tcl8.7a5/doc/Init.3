.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_Init\fR is a helper procedure that finds and \fBsource\fRs the
\fBinit.tcl\fR script, which should exist somewhere on the Tcl library
path.
.PP
\fBTcl_Init\fR is typically called from \fBTcl_AppInit\fR procedures.
.PP
\fBTcl_SetPreInitScript\fR registers the pre-initialization script and
returns the former (now replaced) script pointer.
A value of \fINULL\fR may be passed to not register any script.
The pre-initialization script is executed by \fBTcl_Init\fR before accessing
the file system. The purpose is to typically prepare a custom file system
(like an embedded zip-file) to be activated before the search.
